### Huffman Coding

Simple implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding"> Huffman coding </a> using a binary min-heap.

## Motivation

To review old algorithms and re-familiarize self with C++.

## Notes

Follows an <a href="https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/labs/lab10/index.html">old assignment</a> during my undergrad at the University of Virginia.

The implementation was done by self. :smile:

## Run

`make build` to build.

`./builds/HuffEnc <SOME_TXT_FILE>` to execute.
